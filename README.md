# UDP-Server (Socket Programming)
Simple Messaging Program

Messages are sent over the server and there are client-client connections because of the broadcast.
On the server side, users consisting of random usernames and passwords are created in a file and stored in the users.txt file. If the username and password in the file match, the server is logged in.
Each message and user names sent on the server are encrypted using a predetermined token on the server and then decrypted to the other client.
